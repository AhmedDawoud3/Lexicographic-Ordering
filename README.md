Lexicographical order is a generalization of the alphabetical order
of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered symbols or, more generally,
of elements of a totally ordered set.   
For example  **[1, 2, 3]**   
When applying the lexicographical on will become:
* [1, 2, 3]
* [1, 3, 2]
* [3, 1, 2]
* [3, 2, 1]
* [2, 3, 1]
* [2, 1, 3]

**The current code implementation is based on the following article by Michal Forišek:**
